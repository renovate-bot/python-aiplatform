class AsyncEndpointServiceRestInterceptor:
    """Asynchronous Interceptor for EndpointService.

    Interceptors are used to manipulate requests, request metadata, and responses
    in arbitrary ways.
    Example use cases include:
    * Logging
    * Verifying requests according to service or custom semantics
    * Stripping extraneous information from responses

    These use cases and more can be enabled by injecting an
    instance of a custom subclass when constructing the AsyncEndpointServiceRestTransport.

                    request (~.endpoint_service.UpdateEndpointLongRunningRequest):
                        The request object. Request message for
                    [EndpointService.UpdateEndpointLongRunning][google.cloud.aiplatform.v1beta1.EndpointService.UpdateEndpointLongRunning].
                    retry (google.api_core.retry_async.AsyncRetry): Designation of what errors, if any,
                        should be retried.
                    timeout (float): The timeout for this request.
                    metadata (Sequence[Tuple[str, Union[str, bytes]]]): Key/value pairs which should be
                        sent along with the request as metadata. Normally, each value must be of type `str`,
                        but for metadata keys ending with the suffix `-bin`, the corresponding values must
                        be of type `bytes`.
